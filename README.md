This is just a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/cognitom/symbols-for-sketch">symbols-for-sketch</a> for use on a new project.<br><br>
What I've done:<br>
&bull; gulpfile.js now (lazilly) generates a timestamp and then passes that to the CSS template (for easy version control). <br>
&bull; fontawesome-style.css has been modified to be up-to-date with the most recent Font Awesome release, and I've also added the '-stack' classes.<br>
&bull; Of course the .sketch file is the icon font itself... I need to actually add to that...<br><br>
Nothing amazing, I know. This is what we needed, though.
